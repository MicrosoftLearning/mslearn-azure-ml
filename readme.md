## Hands-on exercises for Azure Machine Learning (v2)

This repository contains the hands-on lab exercises for the Microsoft Learning Paths exploring Azure Machine Learning. The Learning Paths consists of self-paced modules on Microsoft Learn. The labs are designed to accompany the learning materials and enable you to practice using the technologies described them.

You can view the instructions for the lab exercises at [https://microsoftlearning.github.io/mslearn-azure-ml/](https://microsoftlearning.github.io/mslearn-azure-ml/).

## What are we doing?

- To support this course, we will need to make frequent updates to the course content to keep it current with the Azure services used in the course.  We are publishing the lab instructions and lab files on GitHub to allow for open contributions between the course authors and MCTs to keep the content current with changes in the Azure platform.

- We hope that this brings a sense of collaboration to the labs like we've never had before - when Azure changes and you find it first during a live delivery, go ahead and make an enhancement right in the lab source. 

## How do I contribute?

- Anyone can submit a pull request to the code or content in the GitHub repository, Microsoft and the course author will triage and include content and lab code changes as needed.

- You can submit bugs, changes, improvement and ideas.  Find a new Azure feature before we have?  Submit a new demo!
