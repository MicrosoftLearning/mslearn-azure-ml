        "There are many kinds of machine learning algorithm that you can use to train a model, and sometimes it's not easy to determine the most effective algorithm for your particular data and prediction requirements. Additionally, you can significantly affect the predictive performance of a model by preprocessing the training data, using techniques such as normalization, missing feature imputation, and others. In your quest to find the best model for your requirements, you may need to try many combinations of algorithms and preprocessing transformations; which takes a lot of time and compute resources.\n",

You can use the visual interface in [Azure Machine Learning Studio](https://ml/azure.com) or the Python SDK (v2) to leverage this capability. The Python SDK gives you greater control over the settings for the automated machine learning job, but the visual interface is easier to use.\n",
